# Dagster Pypi / Github

This starter kit shows how to build the Dagster's
Software-Defined Assets for an Analytics ETL Workflow with
different deployments for a local and prod environment.

Locally, this project uses DuckDB, dbt, and CSV files to load sample
data and generate example models.

In production, this project uses BigQuery along with the pandas
io manager to fetch data on Pypi downloads from the Bigquery public
dataset, as well as Steampipe to fetch the latest Github data
for stars, forks, and other metrics.

## Overview

The idea around this project is to capture Python package usage data
as well as Github metrics for a given package. This data is then
aggregated and used to generate a model that can be used to
visualize the growth of a package over time.

This project demonstrates the use of partitions and software-defined assets.
Daily partitions are created for fetching data related to both

## Prequisites

### Local Development

To run locally, all you need is to install this package locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Then start dagit

```bash
dagster dev
```

### Production

The production version requires a few things to run:

- A BigQuery project with [credentials configured](https://docs.dagster.io/integrations/bigquery/reference#providing-credentials-as-configuration)
- A running [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/downloads) service with [Github credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github#credentials)
  configured for API access.
- A Hex account with an API key and a project to run

## Using environment variables to handle secrets

Dagster allows using environment variables to handle sensitive information. You can define various configuration options and access environment variables through them. This also allows you to parameterize your pipeline without modifying code.

- BIGQUERY
  - `BIGQUERY_PROJECT` e.g. `my-bigquery-project`
- HEX
  - `HEX_API_KEY` e.g. `super-secret-api-key`
  - `HEX_PROJECT_ID` e.g. `abc-123-def`
- STEAMPIPE
  - `STEAMPIPE_CONN` e.g. `postgresql://steampipe:hunter42@localhost:9193/steampipe`

You can declare environment variables in various ways:
- **Local development**: [Using `.env` files to load env vars into local environments](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets#declaring-environment-variables)
- **Dagster Cloud**: [Using the Dagster Cloud UI](https://docs.dagster.io/master/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables-and-secrets#using-the-dagster-cloud-ui) to manage environment variables
- **Dagster Open Source**: How environment variables are set for Dagster projects deployed on your infrastructure depends on where Dagster is deployed. Read about how to declare environment variables [here](https://docs.dagster.io/master/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets#declaring-environment-variables).

Check out [Using environment variables and secrets guide](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets) for more info and examples.


## Steampipe Setup

If you wish to run Steampipe locally on a Mac you can
run `brew install steampipe`

Then install the Github plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install github
```

You'll need to create a [Github token](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github#documentation:~:text=must%20create%20a-,personal%20access%20token,-and%20assign%20the)
and update the steampipe confing file: `~/.steampipe/config/github.spc`
See the [docs](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github#documentation)
for more information

Finally, run `steampipe service start` to start the steampipe service.
Typically you can use the following connection string
`postgresql://steampipe@localhost:9193/steampipe`

Note that it is `postgresql` and not `postgres`.
